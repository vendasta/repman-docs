## Responding to Positive Reviews

For positive reviews, thank them for their praise, and invite them to come back. You can let them know about upcoming promotions that they might be interested in. You can use your business name in the response to increase your SEO. Remember, positive reviews also make great social posts! If you have Social Marketing connected to the account, click the **Share** icon to share the review on your social networks.

## Responding to Negative Reviews

Negative reviews should also be personalized to the content of the review. You want them to know that you are listening to their concerns. Make sure to apologize for the experience, and invite the reviewer to resolve the issue offline. It's always better to deal with their issues privately.

## Unable to respond to Google Review

You may encounter an error message when attempting to respond to a Google review. This is usually caused by the review being removed from Google shortly after it is pulled into Reputation Management.
