# Reviews Overview

## What is Reviews?
The **Reviews** feature in Reputation Management lets you monitor, manage, and respond to customer reviews pulled from connected review sources. Once accounts are connected, reviews are automatically retrieved and organized under one dashboard. This helps you maintain visibility of customer feedback across multiple platforms in one place.

Use the **Reviews** feature to track your business’s reputation, respond to reviews where supported, and export feedback for internal use or reporting. This reduces time spent switching between review platforms.

## Why is Reviews important?
Monitoring and responding to customer reviews is essential for building trust and maintaining a positive reputation. However, reviews are often scattered across many platforms, making it difficult to manage them efficiently. The Reviews feature solves this by centralizing your reviews and enabling faster responses from a single location.
