## What is review matching?

Review Matching helps you determine whether a review came from a known contact in your customer list. It automatically compares new reviews to existing contact details such as name, email, or phone number.

This feature gives you greater context about each review and helps you track the effectiveness of your review request campaigns.

## Why is review matching important?

- **Know your reviewers**: Identify whether a reviewer is already in your contact list.
- **Measure request effectiveness**: Track how many reviews result from your requests.
- **Smarter follow-up**: Personalize responses based on full customer context.

## What’s included with review matching?

- Matching status indicators in the Reviews section
- Review details in the Contact Timeline
- Request activity insights at the multi-location level
- Filters and metrics to analyze review and NPS performance
