## Job Story
When a business sends out review requests, they want to know if the reviews they receive are from known contacts.  
They need a way to connect reviews with existing customer records.

This helps them measure the effectiveness of requests and track real engagement.  
It also enables more meaningful follow-up actions with customers.  
Ultimately, this gives them clearer visibility into the customer journey.

## Before
Users could request and respond to reviews, but had no visibility into who actually left them.  
This made it difficult to measure request effectiveness or connect feedback back to real customers.

### Key Challenges
- No way to know if a review was from a known contact.  
- Limited ability to measure the true impact of review requests.  
- Follow-ups lacked context, reducing their effectiveness.

## After
With **Review Matching**, reviews are automatically checked against customer data (name, email, phone).  
Businesses can now see which reviews came from known contacts, making it easier to measure engagement and act on feedback.

### Key Benefits
- Identify reviews tied to known contacts with high confidence.  
- Track how review requests convert into actual reviews.  
- Take smarter follow-up actions with full customer context.  
- Lay the groundwork for future features like contact-level engagement scoring.
