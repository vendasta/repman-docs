3. Just SMS

If a user selects 'Just Email,' only email-related options will show such as the email template and email preview.

If a user selects 'Just SMS,' only SMS-related options will show such as the default SMS template (which is not editable) and the SMS preview.

Review links follow the logic below:

- (First) Google if the Google Business Profile is connected OR
- (Second) Facebook - if it is connected

If a user selects 'Email and SMS,' it will show template previews for both.
