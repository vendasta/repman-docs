## What is the Templates Feature?

The Templates feature helps you manage pre-built and custom templates for communicating with customers. You can use templates to send review or NPS requests and to respond to customer feedback. Templates are organized by communication type and are accessible through the `Templates` section in the sidebar.

## Why is the Templates Feature Important?

Using templates helps you:

- Save time by avoiding repetitive manual messages
- Keep communication consistent across your team
- Increase customer engagement with tested message formats
- Personalize communications automatically using dynamic fields

## What's Included with Templates?

Templates are divided into two main categories:

- **Request Templates**: Used for asking customers for reviews or NPS feedback

Each category has dedicated sections for email and SMS (for requests) or for pre-built and custom replies (for responses).

## Response Templates

Response templates are designed for replying to customer reviews and feedback efficiently.

In addition, users can also create new response templates that offer even more unique and specific content (think product or service) that can be tailored to sentiment and star rating.

### Accessing Response Templates

To access the Response Templates, just go to the main navigation in Reputation Management:

### Managing Response Templates

In the Response Template page, you will see all the pre-written default responses to reviews. These can be accessed by clicking the kabob on the far right of the selection. Also note the button for creating a new template in the top right corner and the "Columns" button just below it.
