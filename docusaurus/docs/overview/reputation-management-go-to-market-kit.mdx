## Why is Reputation Management important?

With placement in Google being paramount to local businesses and their online strategy (over 70 percent of online reviews are done at Google and the volume of reviews has grown over 20 percent from 2021 over 2020), just having an online presence is no longer good enough. Having a positive online presence, and managing it effectively, is now more important than ever for businesses.

Reputation Management is an all-in-one dashboard for managing, monitoring, and improving your business clients' online reputations. It makes managing online reviews easy and brings all-important channels into one dashboard. There's never been a more important time to connect with customers online to promote a positive reputation. Empower local businesses to take control of their online reputation with Reputation Management.
