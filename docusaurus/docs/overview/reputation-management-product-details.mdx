**Monitor and manage your online reputation**

**Today, the online reputation of a business is defined by its customers.** Reviews, accurate business information, and social media activity define their online reputation—and often, whether or not a consumer decides to do business with them. Businesses need a way to manage all of these factors in a scalable way.

With Reputation Management, your clients can easily manage and monitor their online reputation—all from one place! They can monitor what people are saying about them online and improve visibility in local searches. It also lets them track their competition, stay in the know with automated alerts, and get progress reports to see how their reputation has improved.
