# Getting Started with Reputation Management

## What is Reputation Management?
Reputation Management is a centralized tool that helps businesses and teams monitor and manage their online presence. It brings together reviews, business listings, and online mentions into one platform, making it easier to take action and stay informed.

Users can track what’s being said across the web, respond to reviews, correct business information, and understand how their business compares to others in their industry. The platform supports flexible use—whether you want to manage everything yourself or collaborate with your team.
