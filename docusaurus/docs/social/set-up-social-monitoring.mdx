## What is Social Monitoring?

Social Monitoring helps you observe activity across connected social media profiles. It includes engagement metrics such as comments, shares, and follower growth over time. You can also compare performance against industry averages using available analytics.

The tool supports both business and employee account monitoring, all from a single dashboard in the `Reputation Management` product.

## Why is Social Monitoring Important?

Monitoring social activity helps you:

- Engage with customers in real time
- Identify brand advocates and influencers
- Capture both positive and constructive feedback
- Generate new leads
- Understand what content drives engagement

You can also monitor employee social activity to help ensure shared messaging and brand alignment across platforms.

## Whatâ€™s Included with Social Monitoring?

Social Monitoring includes the following:

- Activity tracking on connected Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) accounts
- Historical engagement trends, including follower counts and post interactions
- Side-by-side comparison with industry averages via `Social Analytics`
- Monitoring of individual employee X accounts for business-related content
- Notifications when social account connections expire

## How to Set Up Social Monitoring

1. Go to `Reputation Management > Settings > Connect Accounts`.
2. Click the `+` icon in the top-right corner of the account you want to connect.
3. Authenticate your account through the redirected platform page.

Once connected, Social Monitoring will begin tracking data automatically.

## Expired Social Account Notifications

If a connected social profile's token expires, a notification appears near the top of the page. You can choose to:

- Re-authorize the account
- Remove the expired profile

:::warning
An expired token means the platform can no longer access the profile's data. Most social platforms automatically expire tokens every 90 days for security.

To restore functionality, re-authorize the social profile. Without a valid token, recent activity will not appear in your dashboard.
