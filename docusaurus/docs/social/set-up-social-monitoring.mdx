## What is Social Monitoring?

Social Monitoring is a feature within the Reputation Management product that lets you observe, track, and analyze activity from connected social media profiles. You can view engagement on your posts, monitor employee accounts, and compare your performance to industry benchmarks.

## Why is Social Monitoring important?

Monitoring your social channels provides more than just insight into post performance—it helps you understand what content and platforms drive the most traffic and engagement. By tracking comments, shares, likes, and followers across platforms like Facebook and X, you can:

- Respond to your customers faster  
- Identify new leads  
- Track advocacy and brand mentions  
- Gather real-time customer feedback  
- Improve your outreach strategies  

## What’s Included with Social Monitoring?

Social Monitoring provides tools for both business and employee-level insights:

- **Social Monitoring**: Tracks follower growth and engagement on business pages across Facebook and X.
- **Employee Monitoring**: Allows you to observe public activity from employees' X profiles.
- **Social Analytics**: Offers a dashboard view of profile metrics and benchmarks.

## How to Set Up Social Monitoring

To begin monitoring your social activity, you need to connect your social profiles:

1. Go to `Reputation Management > Settings > Connect Accounts`.
2. Click the `+` icon on the account type you want to connect.
3. Follow the redirect to authenticate and connect the account.

You can connect multiple accounts to track all relevant activity from one location.

## Using Social Monitoring Features

### View Social Monitoring Activity

Access the Social tab under the Reputation Management product to:

- Track Facebook page likes and X followers  
- Monitor recent post activity and engagement  

### Use Employee Monitoring

Use Employee Monitoring to view public activity from employees’ X accounts. This helps ensure alignment with your business’s values and messaging, especially when social content spreads quickly.

### Review Social Analytics

Go to `Reputation Management > Analytics > Social` to:

- See performance stats for connected profiles  
- Compare your social engagement to industry averages  

## Handling Expired Social Accounts

When a social profile's connection expires, a notification appears at the top of the Social Monitoring page.

An expired connection (token) occurs when the platform severs the link due to inactivity or routine security measures—typically every 90 days.

To restore functionality:

- Re-authorize the account when prompted
- Or remove the expired profile from the settings

:::warning  
If you do not reauthorize an expired token, you will no longer see recent activity from that profile in Social Monitoring.
