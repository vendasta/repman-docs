# Frequently Asked Questions 

# How are keywords assigned in Reputation Management?

Keywords are not manually assigned, and we do not specifically search for certain words in reviews. Instead, we rely on **Google's Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze the entire review. The algorithm identifies key topics within the review and assigns a **sentiment score** based on its understanding.

It's important to note that this process is powered by an **ML algorithm**, which means it is never expected to be **100% perfect**. The system continuously learns and improves, but occasional inaccuracies may occur.
