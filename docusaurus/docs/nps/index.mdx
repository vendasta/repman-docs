## What is Net Promoter Score (NPS)?

Net Promoter Score is a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement tool that asks customers how likely they are to recommend your business to others on a scale of 0-10. It helps businesses:

- Gauge customer satisfaction before requesting public reviews
- Identify unhappy customers and address their concerns
- Improve overall customer experience
- Target satisfied customers for online reviews

The NPS calculation formula is:

**NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors**

Where:
- **Promoters (9-10)** are customers who would recommend your brand
- **Passives (7-8)** are neutral customers
- **Detractors (0-6)** are customers who wouldn't recommend your brand
