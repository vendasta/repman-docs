# Net Promoter Score (NPS) Overview

## What is NPS?
The **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** feature in Reputation Management Premium allows you to send customer satisfaction surveys before requesting public reviews. This workflow helps identify unhappy customers early, enabling businesses to address concerns before prompting reviews on platforms like Google Business Profile or Facebook.

Using NPS surveys improves feedback accuracy and increases the likelihood of receiving positive public reviews. It also supports internal service improvement by highlighting satisfaction trends.

## Why is NPS important?
Sending direct review requests to all customers may result in negative public feedback, especially from dissatisfied clients. NPS surveys offer a buffer—letting you gather private feedback first. By identifying and responding to detractors privately, you reduce the risk of negative public reviews and strengthen your overall online reputation.
