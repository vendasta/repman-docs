If reviews are showing as duplicates, it is likely that the Google account is connected twice in Reputation Management. You can disconnect the second account in **Reputation Management** under ***Primary Listings***.  

To do this:

**Step 1:** Click on the Google listing to expand the tab

**Step 2:** Click '**Remove this match**' under the duplicate listing
