# Can Reputation Management translate reviews?

If Reputation Management pulls in a review that is in another language, can it be translated? At this time the review cannot be translated. However, if the **Pro** or **Premium** versions of the product are active, the AI-generated responses will populate in the same language. Ex. If a business receives a Google review in Spanish, the AI-generated response will also be in Spanish.
