In the primary listings tab in Reputation Management, the **Company Page URL** is required, not a personal page URL. If you try to enter the personal page URL, you will receive an error message. Here is how to get to the Company Page URL:

1) While on the LinkedIn homepage, use the search bar to search for the company's name.
