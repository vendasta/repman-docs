As long as the associated user has **Manager access** or access to the credentials to log in to the Yelp Dashboard, they should be able to reply to reviews and manage their listing.

However, due to service restrictions, Yelp does not allow direct access from third-party apps to their Dashboard. Therefore, you will be directed to the Yelp listing from the Reputation Management dashboard to respond to customer reviews.
