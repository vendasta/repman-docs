The most likely reason for this is that the account had a Snapshot Report created on it, which activates the trial version of Reputation Management for 7 days. Please bear in mind that this is free and no charges are incurred while the trial is on.

The Snapshot report is dependent on Reputation Management to populate some of the data required for the report.
