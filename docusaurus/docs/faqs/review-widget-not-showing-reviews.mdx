# Why is the Review Widget not showing reviews?

The type of widget installed on your website will determine what reviews are displayed.

The Review Widget, which is the free version only displays reviews left on the My Listing page, Google and Facebook that have been published in Reputation Management.

The **Review Widget Pro**, on the other hand, displays reviews left by a customer on other 3rd party sites. Just to let you know, we are not able to display Yelp reviews.
