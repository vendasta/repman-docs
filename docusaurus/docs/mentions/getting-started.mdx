# Mentions Overview

## What is Mentions?
Mentions helps you track where your business is being talked about online, beyond traditional review sites. It collects content from blogs, news sites, forums, social media platforms, and other sources based on your search terms. A mention can include blog posts, news articles, social media updates, forum comments, or photos.

Sentiment analysis is applied to each mention to help you understand whether the content is positive, neutral, or negative. With Mentions, you can monitor customer sentiment, identify trends, and uncover marketing or support opportunities—without needing to search each platform individually.

## Why is Mentions important?
It can be difficult to keep track of what people are saying about your business across different websites. Mentions brings this information into one place, helping you understand how your brand is perceived and where conversations are happening. This can support your customer service, marketing, and competitive strategy.

## What’s Included with Mentions?
- Automated collection of mentions from blogs, news sites, forums, social media, and other platforms (excluding review sites)
- Sentiment analysis applied to each mention
- Two tracking views: `Monitor Mentions` and `Mentions Timeline`
- Filtering and tagging options for better organization
- Manual sentiment correction when needed
- Search customization via keyword settings

## How to Set Up Mention Searches
1. Go to `Reputation Management` > `Settings` > `Mentions`.
2. In the `Keywords` section, add or update your search terms.
3. Use keywords related to:
   - Your business name (including all variations)
   - Products or services you offer
   - Competitor names or product features
   - Industry-specific terms
   - Marketing campaign names
   - Product functions (e.g. `voice recognition`)

Enclose a keyword phrase in quotes to search for that exact phrase. For example, `"Coke or Pepsi"` will only return mentions with that exact wording.

## Using the Monitor Mentions Tab
The `Monitor Mentions` tab gives you a summary of recent mentions found for your business.

- See the latest mentions across all tracked sources
- Use `View All` to see additional mentions from a specific source

## Using the Mentions Timeline Tab
The `Mentions Timeline` tab allows you to browse and interact with individual mentions.

- View all mentions linked to your business location
- Review sentiment labels and adjust if needed
- Tag mentions as `Starred`, `My Content`, or `Not Relevant`
- Filter mentions by search term, source, or sentiment

## Understanding Tagging Options

### Starred
Use `Starred` to save mentions you want to follow up on or refer to later. You can view all starred mentions using the `Filters` menu.

### My Content
Tagging a mention as `My Content` hides it from your main results. This is useful when mentions come from your own blog or website. These mentions are still saved and can be accessed from the `Filters` menu.

### Not Relevant
Tagging a mention as `Not Relevant` removes it from your results. This helps clean up unrelated content. These mentions are also saved and can be viewed using the `Filters` menu.

If you're seeing too many unrelated mentions, try narrowing your keyword searches to be more specific.

## Customizing Sentiment Ratings
Sentiment analysis estimates whether a mention is positive, negative, or neutral.

- Positive: expresses praise or satisfaction
- Negative: expresses criticism or dissatisfaction
- Neutral: mentions your keywords without an opinion

You can manually adjust the sentiment if a mention is misclassified. For example, slang like “This burger is sick!” might be flagged as negative when it’s actually positive. Use the slider next to the mention to change its sentiment.
