# Google Q&A: Getting Started 

## What is Google Q&A?

Google Q&A allows businesses to view, respond to, and manage customer questions posted directly on their Google Business Profile. You can monitor all customer-submitted questions and answers, and reply to them using the `Reputation Management` platform.

This feature supports proactive engagement by allowing businesses to both answer incoming questions and create helpful FAQs in advance. It helps ensure accurate business information and supports customer interaction at key decision-making moments.

## Why is Google Q&A important?

Customers often look for quick answers when deciding whether to visit or contact a business. Google Q&A is a public forum that any user can contribute to, which means incorrect or unhelpful information can appear if businesses don’t stay involved.

Monitoring Google Q&A allows businesses to:

- Answer common customer questions before they’re asked
- Correct or clarify public-facing information
- Avoid confusion caused by third-party responses
- Improve visibility in local search results by staying active
- Understand customer interests and concerns

## What’s Included with Google Q&A?

- View a full feed of questions and answers on the Google Business Profile
- Track the number of total, answered, and unanswered questions
- Post responses directly to Google from within `Reputation Management`
- Submit your own questions and answer them to create an FAQ-style experience

There are no add-ons or upgrades required—this feature is included in all versions of `Reputation Management`.

## How to Use Google Q&A

To access the feature:

1. Go to `Reputation Management`
2. Select the `Google Q&A` tab

At the top of the page, you'll see:
